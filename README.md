# Description: 
Knot represents what is arguably the final evolutionary form of a spare
bit of 2x4 lumber. By hollowing out the wood, it can be filled by a RedBoard Artemis,
the board for which this sketch was written, two stepper motor controllers, and two
stepper motors. The whole thing is designed such that all this tech is hidden when
the robot is viewed from the top, meaning it just looks like a normal piece of non-robotic
wood when viewed from that perspective. The robot is controlled by tapping on the top
of the wooden chassis. One tap moves the robot forward, two taps turns right, three 
turns left, and four moves the robot backward.

Instructions for building the robot can be found on Instructables.
